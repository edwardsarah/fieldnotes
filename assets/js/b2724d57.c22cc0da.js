Phillip Yenawine, one of the creators of Visual Thinking Strategies, explains that the goal of the practice was to move away from practices which told visitors the correct interpretation of a painting, toward a model which equipped them with the answers to discover meanings for themselves. The success of VTS is reliant on the structure provided by the facilitator, which allows participants to build up to more complex challenges through engaging with increasingly difficult problems.
