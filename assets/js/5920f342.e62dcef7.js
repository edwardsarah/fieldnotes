I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s even different from the gallery or exhibition opening because in those contexts, the focus is on the art.

Late Nights are about play.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Welcome to Field Notes!","description":"It is natural that after a century of rapid technological change, with still incomprehensible consequences for the restructuring of human life, that we are in constant search of the next thing that will tear the world apart and reassemble it in anew.
