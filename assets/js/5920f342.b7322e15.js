I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s even different from the gallery or exhibition opening because in those contexts, the focus is on the art. Coupling the art with two things - noise, and activities, fundamentally changes how viewers interact with it. Late Nights are about play.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Interaction Strategies/stamp-cards":{"id":"Interaction Strategies/stamp-cards","title":"The Stamp Card - The Passport","description":"Mostly I refer to this as the passport because I first encountered it at the EPIC Museum of Irish Immigration in Dublin.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Welcome to Field Notes!","description":"It is natural that after a century of rapid technological change, with still incomprehensible consequences for the restructuring of human life, that we are in constant search of the next thing that will tear the world apart and reassemble it in anew. I do not find that that curiosity, and the anxieties that follow, manifests for most people in productive ways.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Media/museum-apps":{"id":"Media/museum-apps","title":"Museum and Art Apps","description":"Background","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Media/vr":{"id":"Media/vr","title":"Virtual Reality","description":"Whenever people talk about Virtual Reality as if it\'s about to really explode, I think of Old Jaron Lanier Interviews and Dan Olson\'s Metaverse Video. Which is to say, it\'s been around for a long time and a lot of the issues that keep it from being widely adopted or useful in many cases still haven\'t been solved.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Media/vr-galleries":{"id":"Media/vr-galleries","title":"VR in Gallery Settings","description":"Notes from invigilating exhibitions with VR elements","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Museums/audio-guides":{"id":"Museums/audio-guides","title":"Audio Guides","description":"Being an Audio Guide Hater","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Museums/digital-first-museums":{"id":"Museums/digital-first-museums","title":"Digital First Museums","description":"I consider digital-first museums any museum that relies primarily on screen-based content rather than a physical collection of goods.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Theory/experience-questions":{"id":"Theory/experience-questions","title":"Questions to Ask When Designing Digital Interventions","description":"A series of questions developed through my thesis research on participatory digital practices in museums. This draws on work of theorists such as Falk & Dierking, Eric Klopfer & the folks at the MIT Education Arcade, Nina Simon\'s the Participatory Museum, and other thinkers in the visitor experience and digital education space.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Theory/interactive-v-participatory":{"id":"Theory/interactive-v-participatory","title":"Interactive vs. Participatory Experiences","description":"\\"Let me start by saying that an interactive exhibit is not the same as a participatory one. An interactive exhibit is still the single voice of the museum. The user is involved, but the museum continues to hold power. The visitor does something, the exhibit does something back and the visitor is then normally expected to learn a specific piece of information dictated by the museum - so it is outcome-driven.\\" - Graham Black, Meeting the Audience Challenge in the Age of Participation (309)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Theory/someting-for-everyone":{"id":"Theory/someting-for-everyone","title":"Something for Everyone","description":"In the Participatory Museum, Nina Simon notes that while many participatory experiences are creation-focused, not all museum visitors will want to participate in the same way. Options for editing, organizing content, favoriting submissions, and viewing creatings by others still allow for useful participation even if visitors do not want to create something of their own. These activities allow for participants to contribute at different levels of effort and in ways that speak to their particular interests.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Theory/vts":{"id":"Theory/vts","title":"Visual Thinking Strategies","description":"Visual Thinking Strategies is often used in art museums to facilitate dialogue around artworks to help participants notice details about the pieces and come to their own conclusions about its meaning.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
