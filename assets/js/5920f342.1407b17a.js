I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s even different from the gallery or exhibition opening because in those contexts, the focus is on the art. Coupling the art with two things - noise, and activities, fundamentally changes how viewers interact with it. Late Nights are about play.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Interaction Strategies/stamp-cards":{"id":"Interaction Strategies/stamp-cards","title":"The Stamp Card - The Passport","description":"Mostly I refer to this as the passport because I first encountered it at the EPIC Museum of Irish Immigration in Dublin.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Welcome to Field Notes!","description":"It is natural that after a century of rapid technological change, with still incomprehensible consequences for the restructuring of human life, that we are in constant search of the next thing that will tear the world apart and reassemble it in anew. I do not find that that curiosity, and the anxieties that follow, manifests for most people in productive ways.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Media/museum-apps":{"id":"Media/museum-apps","title":"Museum and Art Apps","description":"Background","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Media/vr":{"id":"Media/vr","title":"Virtual Reality","description":"Whenever people talk about Virtual Reality as if it\'s about to really explode, I think of Old Jaron Lanier Interviews and Dan Olson\'s Metaverse Video.
