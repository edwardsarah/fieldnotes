# Virtual Reality 

Whenever people talk about Virtual Reality as if it's about to really explode, I think of [Old Jaron Lanier Interviews](https://www.jaronlanier.com/vrint.html) and [Dan Olson's Metaverse Video](https://youtu.be/EiZhdpLXZ8Q?si=-UGc6DcNpMGk-V1Z&t=899). Which is to say, it's been around for a long time and a lot of the issues that keep it from being widely adopted or useful in many cases still haven't been solved. 

I love my VR headset, but I also recognize it's a pretty niche tool. There's only so much time you want to spend inside a headset, lots of people get sick just by using it, and if you want to play with it safely, you have to keep physical movement around a space to a minimum. There are also lots of issues with haptics we have to solve before the immersion of Virtual Reality represents a marked improvement over what's achievable with video games and the internet! 

I find the immersion less important than the fantasy that VR allows for. In my experience, the most exciting thing about VR is the simulation of mastery over fantastical skills. Games like Beat Saber, Vader Immortal, Pistol Whip, and Superhot involve (mostly) wielding weapons in a way you never could in real life, but can learn to do so effortlessly in the virtual environment.

Outside of guns and lightsabers, the Fisherman's Tale uses its VR environment to play with a sense of scale in interesting ways. 

[Where Thoughts Go](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/where-thoughts-go/2406880882663555/?srsltid=AfmBOoreCHT8JoAgoddrM0uMKJFEtHL3eKCbnIMrsZ5bfx262sy8B3vl) uses VR to create an intimate environment where players feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts in an honest and genuine manner. 

Questions to ask before pursuing VR: 
- Can this be better achieved through a website?
- Can this be better achieved through a standard video game? 
- How does it take advantage of embodied experience or movement? 
- Does this work while confining someone to a small space, or would they need to walk around?
