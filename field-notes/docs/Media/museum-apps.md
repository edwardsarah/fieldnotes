# Museum and Art Apps
## Background
Apps can mostly be divided into camps of 'audio guide,' 'augmented reality platform,' or both. Audio guides tend to be available whether or not you're on museum grounds, whereas AR experiences are more likely to be fixed to a particular location.  Museum apps also often include things like maps and basic details about visiting the museum. 

**The challenge with apps is that most people will not want to download them** - most people do not want to download apps, period, let alone ones they will only use once. They take up space and often are only marginally better than the experience of accessing the same content via the web. 

If creating an app, it's important to ask - can I make this available on both Android and iOS? What is the value add of using an app over a mobile website? How can I give the audiences something unique enough to be worth overcoming the friction of downloading the app in the first place? Also, what makes it worth keeping this app around - are there functionalities that make it useful for visiting the museum (or other museums) in the future?

## Apps I've Tried

A running list - 
### Bloomberg Connects (Audio)
Fairly straightforward audio guide & museum app. Useful on-site when the audio guide is delivered through this platform, but the locations that use it are so scattered it isn't helpful for discovering new things in my particular area. 
### 4th Wall (AR)
An '[AR public art app](https://www.4thwallapp.org/)' created by Nancy Baker Cahill. I downloaded this to see Substrate at LACMA as part of one of their exhibitions in early 2025. The trickiest thing about this app, as with any AR platform, is figuring out how to position it to actually see the artwork in the space it was intended for. 
### Imvizar (AR)
Downloaded for the launch of Mazer's hexahedron exhibition & public art piece in Charlemont Square. Similarly to 4th Wall, the most difficult thing was lining up the experience to display correctly. Imvizar's experiences are linked to particular locations and I haven't really had another reason to pick up the app since then. 
### MOCO Play & MOCO Outside
These are both AR-based apps. Outside is for an exhibition of digital works outside the museum grounds, and Play adds AR elements to existing artworks. In either case, the main purpose is spectacle. 
I did enjoy that you could take video and photos of the AR elements on the real environment, but this did crash my computer
### Map My Visit
This is an audio guide that you trigger by tapping your phone on the label you want to hear more about. In use at the Stedelijk Museum in Amesterdam. Unlike other audio guides, this can't be used outside the museum essentially at all. 
### Smartify
Mileage varies from museum on their Smartify pages - some only use it to deliver one tour, others take full advantage of the platform to offer a full suite of different tours and AR experiences. Of the museum apps I've downloaded, it's the one that feels the most fleshed out, with the most potential to stick around for a long time.

Smartify also has a customization feature that uses AI to create unique tours to suit your personal tastes, and various language options (such as ASL or audio-description tours).

### Hamburger Kunsthalle
The officiall app of the museum in Hamburg. I downloaded this originally as a way to access the audio tour and some other (likely retired) features in the museum I never could get working. The UI is a bit more interesting than the traditional audio guide elements, but otherwise it feels very standard.
