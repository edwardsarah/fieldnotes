# VR in Gallery Settings
Notes from invigilating exhibitions with VR elements
## You will always need a facilitator
	1. Sorry to all of the VR-nerds out there, but most people aren't familiar with VR interfaces! They're working with limited intuition on the controls and how to move in the space, and are likely to click something or go somewhere they shouldn't.
		1. With Oculus headsets, a lot of people struggle with the 'meta' and 'menu' buttons, and the position of the different triggers. It's difficult to tell where it is or what to press if you aren't familiar with VR controllers.
	2. A side-effect of the limited intuition is that **they don't always know when something has gone wrong**. Be on the look out for cues they've left or crashed the project so you can check in even if they haven't reached out for help.

## Keep the experience short and sweet
	1. Some people will spend forever in the headset and you cannot let them. Explain any time limits before they put on the headset, and stick to them. This also means designing your content to not take a million years to go through, so people don't feel like they've missed out. 
    
## Mark out a safe place for it.
	1. The reasons for this are twofold:
		1. They will walk around and move their hands - you don't want anyone to get hit, you don't want them to bump anything they shouldn't.
		2. Having a VR headset (obviously) makes you a lot less aware of what's going on around you. It's extremely alarming if someone touches you and you didn't know they were there. 
			1. Addendum: if you have to touch someone while they have the headset on, explain to them what you're doing before you do it.
