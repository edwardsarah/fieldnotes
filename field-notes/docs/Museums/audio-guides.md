# Audio Guides
## Being an Audio Guide Hater

I have never been a massive fan of audio guides. They certainly have their place, but not one I am particularly interest in for most contexts. For the last couple of years I have been torturing myself by actively seeking them out in hopes of understanding how they might work for me. 

### The Ghost of the Guided Tour

The audio tour is the spiritual successor of the guided tour. its benefits are in its greater accessibility and flexibility - you decide the length of your tour and the stops you wish to take.

The problem with replicating the guided tour method of standing in front of one artifact and hearing about it for an extended period of time is that it feels incongruous with my viewing experience and how other people anticipate I will move around the space. 

If everyone is doing the same audio tour, you can roughly expect the same flow. People understand why you might be standing in a particular spot for a long time. If the audio tour is optional, there’s a lot more friction in standing in front of a painting for that long. You feel people move around you in a different way, hurrying you along. 

And how does the physical space accommodate the audio tour? Are there places to sit? Or to stand out of the way? In a lot of cases, it feels more like the tour was an afterthought than an intentional part of the experience.  

### Audio Guides as Innovation?

There is a sense I get with new takes on audio tours, such as the ones on the Smartify platform, of audio guides as a way of increasing visitor agency. By creating audio tours that speak to a more diverse set of audience interests (building architecture, activities for children, artists of color in the collection), museums facilitate different ways of interacting with their collections & therefore more reasons to come back.

This is not a bad thing. What I am wary of is when pursuing methods like this comes at the cost of opportunities for more powerful expressions of visitor agency. This sort of audio guide maintains the relationship of museum and visitor as a one-way form of communication, where participatory methods can instead elevate a dialogue between the museum and its audience.

When it comes to the types of themes museums use in their audio guides, it is worth thinking about whether these are thematic categories that audiences are actually interested in, or if they continue to prioritize museum interests in particular learning outcomes or ways of being in the space. 

## Great Uses for Audio Guides

The best audio tours are, obviously, the ones where the exhibition is designed with the tour in mind! 

### Musical Instruments Museum: an Audio Guide that Matches Its Context

The audio guide for this museum in Brussels allows you to listen to the sound of the instruments on display as they are played. 

- Listening to the audio guide doesn’t require staring at the object - you can wander around and get the same experience
- What is played provides a window into the style of music it would be used for
- There’s an easy point of discussion with friends about what you each discovered
- It’s a lot of fun!

There is an obvious connection between a musical instrument museum and an audio guide, but there are plenty of other instances where music is a crucial aspect of the experience and can be leveraged in interesting ways, such as in film or video games.

### Beyond the Biography

Some audio tours forego discussion of a singular piece in favor of viewing multiple pieces in conversation, or the curatorial direction of entire rooms. The Stedelijk’s audio guide, for example, features curators discussing how the pieces in each room work together under a broader theme. This gives visitors flexibility to wander around, and also allows them to start seeing the work in comparison to each other, rather than evaluating each one individually. Cool!

### Aesthetics & Logistics

Logistics - cases where international museums expect a large number of visitors with a diverse set of native languages, and it is easier to provide portable audio guides than have an ever-multiplying set of translated texts on display

Aesthetics - institutions where aesthetics are particularly important! The Patek Philippe Museum is primarily focused on the visual display of its collection, so keeping descriptive text minimal and opting to deliver context through audio guides instead allows for a different vibe.

## Points of Friction

### Finding the Audio Tour

A lot of museums are moving towards third-party apps, like Bloomberg Connects, to carry their audio tour. I think this is great, but it also needs to be incredibly clear that this is the case. A couple of times I’ve tried to find an audio guide by searching for it in the App Store, only to realize the only available search options were for third-party apps posing as official guides. Technologies of access may also change over time, rendering one pathway of accessing the tour obsolete. 

It is better plan for every possible access scenario, not just the best-case. What would someone come across if they searched for the audio tour online? On your website? Or on your soundcloud page? 

**The Stedelijk Museum**

The Stedelijk Museum (in 2023, at least) had large structures at the front of the museum hosting towers of audio guides, with QR codes for downloading the correct app on these structures. Trying to find the audio guide through the app store lead to paywalled content by an independent developer. The website led to a separate set of tours, which were also different to the ones accessible via QR codes on individual artworks. 

### Finding Everything Else

Following audio guides at the Patek Philippe Museum was a struggle. With so many clocks in one room, and audio guides limited to only a selection of them, I could never figure out what direction I needed to go in to find the next stop. Without clear signposting or ways to indicate the path to follow, I ended up backtracking quite a bit. 

### Moving Too Slowly

Many audio tours are still created without speed controls. While I can acknowledge that this can be a method of staggering visitors by keeping them moving at a consistent pace (especially in historical sites where only so many people can fit in a room at a time) - I am zoomer brained! I watch videos at 2x speed and I want my audio tours to let me do the same! 

Smartify is one of the audio guides I’ve noticed  

## Other Notes

### Personal v Supplied Devices

I personally like using audio guides on my own device rather than a museum’s, but this works better in some cases than in others. Some considerations of target audience are important here - a lot of people do have smartphones and carry headphones around with them all the time, but small children or less tech-savvy groups might have a difficult time with this. Connecting to audio guides or downloading apps is another reason it’s important for cultural institutions to have free wifi! 

How the audio tour is accessed sends different signals about its importance to the overall experience. If the audio tour is supplied to every ticketholder when the enter the venue, it feels more important to use it than if it’s only accessible via QR code stickers near the objects. 

### Opportunities for Audio Guides

Generally I would love to see audio guides used in more creative and immersive ways. 

I want more audio guides that don’t just regurgitate historical information. I want to hear from the artists about their intentions, the curators, how the piece has been preserved over time. There’s so much flexibility in what you can say about a work of art.
