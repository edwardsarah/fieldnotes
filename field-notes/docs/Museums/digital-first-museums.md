# Digital First Museums

I consider digital-first museums any museum that relies primarily on screen-based content rather than a physical collection of goods. 

A lot of these museums are first and foremost tourist attractions. They tend to be pricier, which means once you've been once you aren't necessarily thinking about going back. I've noticed that the price point also means more of a focus on spectacle, so it feels dynamic and interesting enough that you've gotten your money's worth.

I've also come across a fair few hybrid museums, with sections dedicated to digital media and others focused on physical collections. Some that come to mind are the Museum of Literature Ireland and [[Hyde Park Barracks]] in Sydney. 

**Good Practice:** EPIC Emigration Museum, Belgian Beer World
The best uses of digital-first exhibitions use creative strategies for communicating content and prompting visitors to interact with the content. 

EPIC excels particularly because of its creative use of sets which makes the rooms feel full and distinct from each other, unique uses of interaction to display content (the rotating pucks in the sports room are my favorite), and the sheer variety of interfaces from one room to the next. Different rooms allow for different depths of experience - some are focused on an overview of a topic, others dive deeper into personal stories, others are just fun. 

**Where It Falters:** Museum of Literature Ireland (MoLI)
The main issue with the use of digital media in MoLI is the tone shift. The first few rooms in MoLI are devoid of much digital media at all, so by the time you reach the parts of the museum that are, it feels like walking into a completely different space. There are ways to modernize a museum while maintaining its existing aesthetics, but that wasn't really the case here. 

**Where It Falls Flat:** Trinity College Dublin - Book of Kells Experience
In any digital-first experience, I only ever want to be pleasantly surprised that something does respond to my actions. I never want to wonder why something else does not. 

The busts talk and move on their own, regardless of where you are standing. The musical instruments play in a fixed sequence with no mind to where your fingers are. Key books are illuminated in the library but do not react if you touch them. And the QR codes direct you to digitized materials, but scanning them does not change the visuals on the wall. The room is mostly grey and void of details, so these are the only things to focus on. 

The pavilion can best be described as an evolution of the immersive art warehouse experiences, and had the experience been confined to its last two elements (a 360 short film about the history of the Book of Kells, and projection mapping of the history of the Old Library) I probably would not think twice about it. 

The QR codes seem like a nice idea, but there's not enough context for any of the objects for me to want to seek out more information for them.
