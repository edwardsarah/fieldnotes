# Questions to Ask When Designing Digital Interventions

A series of questions developed through my thesis research on participatory digital practices in museums. This draws on work of theorists such as Falk & Dierking, Eric Klopfer & the folks at the MIT Education Arcade, Nina Simon's the Participatory Museum, and other thinkers in the visitor experience and digital education space. 

## Visit Contexts
### Personal Context
- How does this speak to a user’s personal interests?
### Sociocultural Context
- How does this allow for engagement as a group?
- How can you make people comfortable interacting with the tool as intended? 
- How does it impact the experience of other visitors not directly engaged with the experience?
- Is everyone intended to use it, or is it intended for a select number of visitors who opt-in? 
### Physical Context
- Where is it located? What sort of space does it take up?
- Does the museum provide the devices, or are they supplied by the user? 
- If it’s on a mobile device, how is this supported by the museum’s infrastructure? (e.g. free wifi)
## Visitor & Museum Needs
### Museum
- What role do staff or volunteers play in facilitating this experience? 
- What are the time and budgetary constraints on this project? 
- How are you measuring user uptake and engagement? 
- Does this approach make sense in the context of the museum’s identity?
### Visitor Motivations
- What type of visitor are you primarily designing for?
- Does the experience lend itself to different uses based on visitor motivation?
### Levels of Engagement
- What options do users have for how they choose to engage with the experience? 
- Active contribution / commenting on or critiquing other contributions / sorting or filtering other contributions / passive observation
## Interaction Design 
### Learning Games 
- Are the subject and the format for the experience a match?
- What is intrinsically fun or interesting about the subject that can be explored here?
- Is the challenge meaningful?
- What skills does this experience intend to teach the user? 
### Participation
- What sort of dialogue does this create between the user and the museum?
- How much agency is afforded to the user in this interaction? 
E.x. expression through fixed responses, responses structure through prompts, free & open communication
- Given the topic, what tactics for moderation are useful or necessary here? 
- What are the benefits to the user and the museum from creating this dialogue?
### User Experience Design
- What does the digital format allow for that an analog approach would not? 
- Is it immediately clear on first impression what the user is supposed to do?
- Does it feel ‘nice’ to use?
- How does the experience allow for a sense of competency, belonging, or excitement?
