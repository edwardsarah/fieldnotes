# The Stamp Card - The Passport 
Mostly I refer to this as the passport because I first encountered it at the EPIC Museum of Irish Immigration in Dublin.

How it works: On arrival, you are given a card. There are machines placed around the museum where you can stamp your card. Finding all of them completes your collection.

The passport can be a fun way to encourage repeat visits or seeking out hidden corners of a museum. As an engagement strategy, it risks creating a gamified approach to visiting an institution, so there should be a balance between using it as a way to get people through the door and critically thinking about how to direct their actions once they're there. 

Similar strategies might include: scavenger hunts, punch cards, or sticker books (for young visitors)

## Great Examples in Museums
### EPIC the Irish Emigration Museum
The stamp card is a passport - a nod to the theme of the museum - but it also functions as a map of the museum, with each space for a stamp indicating the theme of the room it belongs to. EPIC is a relatively small space consisting of a series of interconnected rooms, so collecting stamps is an easy way to visualize where you've been and how long you have before you reach the end. 

### Micropia
The [micropia stamp card](https://www.artis.nl/en/artis-micropia/daily-schedule/collect-all-microbe-stamps) looks like a peri dish, with spaces for collecting the microbes you encounter throughout the museum. There are a few ways this improves over the EPIC experience:
- finding the stamps is its own adventure - EPIC's linear structure makes collecting the stamps very straightforward, but in micropia they are scattered in different corners of the museum. collecting them all means seeking out all of the small niches in the space and comparing with others who may have collected something you missed
- something to do with your stamps afterward - the end of your visit to micropia, you can scan your stamp card to see your collection of microbes, and learn more about them. it's a very satisfying way to wrap up the experience

## Outside the Museum
Positive examples I've seen outside museums encourage building a relationship with an existing brand or location, or visiting multiple locations throughout the country or globe. Such examples include:

### Lego Passport
[LEGO Passports](https://lego.bricksmegastore.com/pages/passport-program?srsltid=AfmBOorqd-fVn09CEFFZhja53eHqr_jENIyapWoTg-d8uliEz1n7Emg2) can be acquired for free at any official LEGO store. There are different stamps for every location, and every month of the year, so even if you don't travel, there's still a reason to visit the LEGO store in your local area.

### Rumba Map & Passport
[Rumba](https://www.rumbaonpike.com/full-rum-list) in Seattle, WA highlights the diversity of origins and styles of rum through its Rum Map & Rum Passports. 
Regulars at the bar can start by completing the Map, where they note down rums they've tried from a set list of countries (with a few extra challenges). Once finished, they can move on to the Rum passport - a more extensive list of challenges that comes with its own rewards on completion.
