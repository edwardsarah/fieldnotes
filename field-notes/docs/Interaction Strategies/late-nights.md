# Late Nights

Late Nights engage audiences because it allows them to experience the art in a different context. I’d argue that it’s even different from the gallery or exhibition opening because in those contexts, the focus is on the art. Coupling the art with two things - noise, and activities, fundamentally changes how viewers interact with it. Late Nights are about play.

### Brand Recognition
If you’re a cool museum, you’ll attract a cool crowd no matter what you do - people want to spend time at the Tate Modern because *it's the Tate Modern*. There's no extra barrier to seeing it as a place to go, because the crowd interested in a late night already has reasons to go to that museum.
### Audience Access
Who you target and how you ticket will signal to specific audiences that they are welcome in your space. 
LACMA's teen nights were free & teen-only, so I always made a point to go when they were on. 
In contrast, for all of the years I lived in Boston, I never went to a Late Night at the ICA because I wasn't old enough to attend. 
### Frequency
From the visitor perspective, the power is not in the event itself but its expression of the museum as an open space. If it happens too infrequently, people will feel shut out rather than let in. 
While I would have liked to go to a late night at the National Museum Scotland, but outside of Fringe, I could never figure out when they would be. The Tate Modern runs events every last Friday of the month, so there's no guessing involved. 
The converse of this is that when they happen too frequently, they stop feeling like special events. Many museums have 'Thursday Lates' or similar evenings where they stay open past their traditional hours. While this is a great way to welcome in audiences who can't stop by during work hours, it doesn't have the same function as a late night.
### Programming
Programming is important on many different levels - in the same way that ticketing & targeting particular groups shapes the audience for the event, so do the people you choose to bring in to facilitate the event. 


I can’t overstate how important the noise is. Having music and activities on fills the space in a way typical museum hours don’t do. It encourages people to talk while they look at the art, tell their friends what they’re seeing and be loud about it. It also takes the focus away from the art viewing and puts it on exploration. 

Being at a museum late is about being in the museum, not seeing a particular exhibition (although special or discounted access to special exhibitions can be a very nice part of it!). What is on display feels secondary to being present in the space, and the inclusion of other activities leads to a more relaxed sense of proper ways to behave in a museum. In this way, it's a great tool for reinforcing the notion that there is more to the museum experience than education and silent reflection.
