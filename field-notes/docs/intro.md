# Welcome to Field Notes!

This is an overview of notes on new media and forms of interaction as I've collected them over time. It focuses mostly on the applications of these technologies and participation strategies in museuns, but draws from sources across a lot of different things I've encountered in many walks of life, because I believe the most innovative approaches will take inspiration from everywhere it can find it. 

I am in the process of porting a lot of these notes over from an older website, so please bear with me as I sort out the glitches on a new platform!
