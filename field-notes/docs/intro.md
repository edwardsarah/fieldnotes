# Welcome to Field Notes!

It is natural that after a century of rapid technological change, with still incomprehensible consequences for the restructuring of human life, that we are in constant search of the next thing that will tear the world apart and reassemble it in anew. I do not find that that curiosity, and the anxieties that follow, manifests for most people in productive ways. 

What most people think they know about the future of digital technology is what they can imagine it could do. And because they do not use the tools they are imagining a future for, they do so without knowing their limitations. It is a future as informed by fact as by science fiction. 

I believe there are ways of creating a positive future where our digital lives meaningfully enhance our physical ones. Building that future is a process that requires understanding the tools available and not allowing only those with the most power to put them to use.

This is an archive of my reflections on new technologies and the cultural institutions they have the potential to transform. By creating an open-ended dialogue about where their strengths and weaknesses lie, I hope to contribute what I can to ongoing discussions of how we should shape this future for ourselves.

I am in the process of porting a lot of these notes over from an older website, so please bear with me as I sort out the glitches on a new platform!
